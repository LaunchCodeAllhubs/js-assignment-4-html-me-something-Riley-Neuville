      <h2 id = "10">10. Guild Wars</h2>
      <img src = images/GuildWars.jpg alt = "Guild wars cover">
      <p>The first game on this list is Guild Wars. Despite being less popular in the world of MMORPGs it was one of the few that did not require subscription payments, and therefore one of the only ones my parents would get for my brothers and I. It was a simple game where you pick a class and play through the storyline, but had one mechanic that set it apart from other games. Despite the hundreds of abilities you could obtain for your character, only eight could be equipped at any given time. This forced players to optimize their builds around certain abilities that worked well together and really focus on what you wanted to accomplish as a part of a team. You could spend hours planning and optimizing a build and have just as much fun as playing the game. To this day I still think this is one of the most underrated games of its time.</p>

      <h2 id="9">9. Runescape</h2>
      <img src = images/1920_oldschoolrunescape-181863.png alt = "Runescape action image">
      <p>Runescape is next on this list for slightly different reasons despite being a similar game. The graphics and gameplay were worse, but it was accessible and free for everyone. This made it a much more social experience and was one of the first times I was able to play games with friends online. Using video games as a way to stay connected with friends is an important part of who I am to this day and it all started with Runescape.</p>

      <h2 id="8">8. Rollercoaster Tycoon</h2>
      <img src = images/RollercoasterTycoon.jpg alt = "Rollercoaster Tycoon cover">
      <p>From a technical standpoint Rollercoaster Tycoon still might be the most impressive video game ever made. As a child I didn't know the game was completely coded in assembly, but I did know it was very fun and presented design challenges I had never encountered before. it also cost 99&#162; at a scholastic book fair. Banking turns to prevent nausea, placing stalls and paths to maximize time spent in the park, this game opened my eyes to how fun design and engineering can be and will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
