      <h2 id = "10">10. Guild Wars</h2>
      <img src = images/GuildWars.jpg alt = "Guild wars cover">
      <p>The first game on this list is Guild Wars. Despite being less popular in the world of MMORPGs it was one of the few that did not require subscription payments, and therefore one of the only ones my parents would get for my brothers and I. It was a simple game where you pick a class and play through the storyline, but had one mechanic that set it apart from other games. Despite the hundreds of abilities you could obtain for your character, only eight could be equipped at any given time. This forced players to optimize their builds around certain abilities that worked well together and really focus on what you wanted to accomplish as a part of a team. You could spend hours planning and optimizing a build and have just as much fun as playing the game. To this day I still think this is one of the most underrated games of its time.</p>

      <h2 id="9">9. Runescape</h2>
      <img src = images/1920_oldschoolrunescape-181863.png alt = "Runescape action image">
      <p>Runescape is next on this list for slightly different reasons despite being a similar game. The graphics and gameplay were worse, but it was accessible and free for everyone. This made it a much more social experience and was one of the first times I was able to play games with friends online. Using video games as a way to stay connected with friends is an important part of who I am to this day and it all started with Runescape.</p>

      <h2 id="8">8. Rollercoaster Tycoon</h2>
      <img src = images/RollercoasterTycoon.jpg alt = "Rollercoaster Tycoon cover">
      <p>From a technical standpoint Rollercoaster Tycoon still might be the most impressive video game ever made. As a child I didn't know the game was completely coded in assembly, but I did know it was very fun and presented design challenges I had never encountered before. it also cost 99&#162; at a scholastic book fair. Banking turns to prevent nausea, placing stalls and paths to maximize time spent in the park, this game opened my eyes to how fun design and engineering can be and will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

      <h2 id="7">7. Frogger</h2>
      <img src = images/frogger-ps1.png alt = "Frogger action image">
      <p>Frogger is an iconic game, mostly for the original arcade version, but this adaptation will always be special to me. It was one of the first games my brothers and I ever owned for the original playstation. The controls were difficult for me being very young, and the game would restart if you lost too many lives making progressing very difficult. I would have given up on this game completely but my brothers loved it and I wanted to be good at it like they were. I had to practice and learn from every mistake I made to keep up with them. To others this would probably ruin the point of games that are supposed to be fun, but it shaped the way I view video games and challenges.</p>

   <article class = "game">
      <h2 id="6">6. Fifa</h2>
      <img src = images/Fifa11.webp alt = "Fifa Action Image">
      <p>I played soccer growing up, so naturally Fifa would make the list. Playing the game against my brothers really fueled a competitive side of me that hadn't existed up until that point. Fifa was also a more socially acceptable game to play too much of. You weren't a nerd, you just liked soccer a lot! This is one of the games on this list that I still play with friends from middle and high school, and I imagine I will continue to play it as long as they keep releasing the same exact game every 12 months.</p>

   <article class = "game">
      <h2 id="5">5. Age of Mythology</h2>
      <img src = images/AoM.jpg alt = "AoM Cover Art">
      <p>Age of Mythology is a bit of a funny entry on this list. It is a spin off of the much more popular Age of Empires, but for some reason this game clicked with me while empires never did. Maybe it was the fun mythological beasts you could create, like minotaurs or valkyraes, or the historical military units like Greek hoplites, but something about it had me hooked. I was new to real time strategy games so it took me a long time to be able to play online without getting destroyed, but little by little I became passable and started winning a few games. Eventually I became a huge fan of other RTS games as well like starcraft and Command and Conquer, but it all started with Age of Mythology.</p>

      <h2 id="4">4. Super Smash Brothers</h2>
      <img src = images/Supersmashbros64.jpg alt = "Super Smash Brothers 64 cover art">
      <p>I think most people have fond memories of playing one of the super smash brothers games with friends or family when they were younger. I never actually owned the game as a kid, but a friend did and everytime we would sleepover we would play on his N64 until way too late. We would add punishments for the person who got last like gross drinks or running around the house at midnight. Eventually when I was a bit older we got a Wii with Super Smash Brothers BRAWL and the game continued to be a favorite amongst myself, my brothers and my friends. This is the only game on the list I've ever played in an in person competitive setting as well. My freshman year of college someone in my dorm had a copy of Melee, and would hook it up to a tv in our hallway. We would play for hours and later learned there were tournaments happening on campus. We all showed up and got destroyed by players much better than us. They were all very nice though and continued to play with us and teach us throughout the year. In the following years I continued to play with the club on campus and even participated in a tournament between colleges. From a coding standpoint, there is a very cool project called slippi that was created by one guy in 2021. It took an old game for gamecube and created online rollback netcode for it on PC.</p>

      <h2 id="3">3. Pokemon</h2>
      <img src = images/SI_GBA_PokemonRuby_enGB_image1600w.jpg alt = "Pokemon Ruby Cover Art">
      <p id = "testp" class = "funParagraph">This is the only game on this list that was played on a handheld device. Realistically any pokemon game could've made this list, but ruby was the one I played the most. Pokemon is widely considered one of the all time greatest games for a reason. Every time a new game would come out my brothers and I would all save up to get a copy and we would race to see who could beat the game first. This went on from 1998 all the way until 2012. I can't spend nearly as much time playing video games as I did back then, but I still try and get most of the new games and slowly finish them whenever I have free time.</p>

      <h2 id="2">2. Spyro</h2>
      <img src= images/Spyro.jpg alt = "Spyro Action Image">
      <p>These next two games are amazing in their own right, but have a special place in my heart due to who I played them with. My older brother Kyle loved these next two, and nothing made me happier as a kid then to play with him or just watch him play. Spyro is a strange game about a dragon and a cheetah rescuing eggs and collecting gems and yet it is one of the most fun experiences gaming had to offer back in the late 90's. The platforming felt amazing compared to other games made around that time, and the puzzles were the right level of difficulty for a 7 year old. The magic of the first playthrough was enough that my brother and I would replay the game over and over trying to collect more hidden easter eggs or improve our speedrunning times. The series would eventually be ruined by a different developer who bought the rights, but luckily the original 3 games were recently remastered. The remaster stays true to the originals with only small modifications in gameplay and huge upgrades to the visuals. Being able to replay these games and feel like a child again was an amazing experience that I am very grateful for. </p>

      <h2 id="1">1. Crash Bandicoot</h2>
      <img src= images/CrashBandicoot.jpg alt = "Crash Bandicoot Action Image">
      <p>Last on this list is Crash Bandicoot. Crash is an adventure platforming game where you smash boxes, collect wumpa fruit, and spin away various enemies like crabs, skunks, and creepy scientists. As I mentioned in the last entry, this game is amazing on it's own, but also because of the memories made playing it with my family. When the first game came out I was barely old enough to know what was going on, but I would watch my brothers play and cheer them on. They used to make fun of me because I would get so excited watching them that I would jump in my seat whenever there was a close call. Eventually I was old enough to join the rotation, handing off the controller after every 3 deaths. Naturally that meant I was playing for all of 30 seconds, and each of them would play for about 10 minutes before dying 3 times. It didn't bother me because I had just as much fun watching and spending time with them as I did playing. Eventually we got older and I got better, but they had moved on to different games and interests. The games became a comfort to me. Something I could play by myself, but still feel that same excited feeling I did as a kid. Many years later the first 3 games were remastered and I was playing them with a girl I had been dating for a month or so. We now live together and our walls are decorated with Crash Bandicoot memorabilia. This game has given me so many great memories and it will always hold a very special place in my heart.</p>
